The Engagement Engine sits at the center. Every patient action flows through it. The Engine
then orchestrates which agents should respond and in what order.
Interaction Pattern 1: Glucose Logging
Patient logs: 145 mg/dL (fasting glucose at 7:15 AM)
1. 2. 3. Engagement Engine receives event: Classifies as: glucose_log, fasting, 145 mg/dL
Engine checks: Is this emergency?: No (safe range). Proceeds with normal routing.
Engine → Clinical Monitor: Sends: {patient_id, glucose_value: 145, timestamp: 7:15
AM, context: fasting}
4. Clinical Monitor analyzes: Compares to target (130 - slightly above), checks 7-day
pattern (stable 140-150), calculates time in range. Assessment: Safe, stable pattern.
5. Clinical Monitor → Engine: Returns: {status: SAFE, message: "Stable",
needs_correlation: true}
6. Engine decision: Not emergency, should correlate with last night. Routes to Health
Insights.
7. Engine → Health Insights: Request: "Correlate this fasting glucose with yesterday
evening"
8. 9. Health Insights queries Lifestyle Coach: Asks: "What did patient do last night?"
Lifestyle Coach → Health Insights: Responds: "Patient walked 18 minutes after dinner
at 8:45 PM"
10. Health Insights analyzes pattern: Patient history shows: With evening walk → fasting
142-148. Without walk → fasting 158-165. Today's 145 is consistent with walk pattern.
11. Health Insights → Engine: Returns: {correlation: "walk_helped", impact: "16 mg/dL
reduction", message: "That evening walk helped!"}
12. Engine synthesizes responses: Combines: Clinical safety ✓ + Walk correlation ✓ +
Streak status (18 days)
13. Engine checks notification limits: Sent today: 0 (reset at midnight). Last notification:
13 hours ago. OK to send.
14. Engine → Patient: Delivers: "✓ Fasting: 145 mg/dL (Stable) 🔥 18-day streak! That
evening walk helped! Your fasting averages 145 with walks vs 160 without. Next: Take
medication at 8 AM"
15. All agents update their data: Clinical Monitor: logs glucose. Lifestyle Coach: validates
walk effectiveness. Health Insights: confirms prediction accuracy. Engagement Engine:
updates streak and score.Interaction Pattern 2: Meal Logging
Patient uploads breakfast photo at 9:00 AM (poha + tea)
16. Engagement Engine receives: Event: meal_log, meal_type: breakfast, photo attached
17. Engine → Lifestyle Coach: Sends: {photo_data, timestamp: 9:00 AM, meal_type:
breakfast, patient_id}
18. Lifestyle Coach processes photo: Image recognition identifies: poha, tea. Estimates:
40g carbs, 10g protein, 5g fat.
19. Lifestyle Coach queries own history: Checks: "How many times has patient eaten
poha? What was glucose response?" Finds: 8 previous poha breakfasts, average post-
meal glucose: 172 mg/dL (range 165-180)
20. Lifestyle Coach → Engine: Returns: {foods: ["poha", "tea"], carbs: 40g,
predicted_glucose: "170-180 mg/dL", confidence: 0.87, assessment: "good_choice"}
21. Engine → Health Insights: Request: "Store this meal for later correlation"
22. Health Insights stores meal data: Will correlate with post-breakfast glucose when
logged in 2 hours
23. Engine → Lifestyle Coach: Question: "Should we remind patient to check glucose after
this meal?"
24. Lifestyle Coach → Engine: Answer: "Yes, schedule reminder for 11:00 AM (2 hours
post-meal)"
25. Engine schedules reminder: Adds to notification queue: 11:00 AM check reminder
26. Engine composes message: Combines Lifestyle Coach feedback + prediction +
scheduled reminder
27. Engine → Patient: Delivers: "Poha - good choice! ✓ Based on your history (8 times):
Expected glucose 170-180 mg/dL. I'll remind you to check at 11 AM."
28. 11:00 AM - Reminder fires: Engine sends: "Check post-breakfast glucose now"
29. Patient logs: 172 mg/dL
30. Engine multi-routes: Sends to Clinical Monitor (safety) AND Health Insights
(prediction validation) simultaneously
31. Clinical Monitor response: Safe, within target (<180), no concerns
32. Health Insights analyzes: Predicted: 170-180. Actual: 172. Accuracy: Excellent (within
2 mg/dL). Updates: Poha reliability confirmed (9th occurrence, always 165-180 range,
confidence: 0.92)
33. Health Insights → Lifestyle Coach: Notification: "Poha is highly reliable for this
patient. Encourage continued use."
34. Engine synthesizes: Clinical safety ✓ + Prediction accuracy ✓ + Pattern reliability ✓
35. Engine → Patient: Delivers: "Perfect! 172 mg/dL - right where I predicted. Your body
consistently responds to poha this way. This is a reliable breakfast! 🎯"
36. Lifestyle Coach updates: Adds poha to patient's "recommended foods" list, increases
reliability score
37. Health Insights stores: Updated correlation: poha → 172 mg/dL average (n=9, SD=5.2,
very high confidence)Interaction Pattern 3: Symptom Report (Emergency)
Patient reports: "I feel dizzy" at 2:30 PM
38. Engagement Engine receives: Event: symptom_report, text: "I feel dizzy", severity:
unknown

Patient reason: temporary busy, Reduced expectations effectiveKey Orchestration Principles
Engagement Engine is the Hub
Every patient event flows through the Engagement Engine. No agent talks directly to
patients.
Agents are Specialists
Each agent handles one domain. Clinical Monitor doesn't do nutrition. Lifestyle Coach
doesn't do medication.
Collaboration Through Engine
When agents need information from each other, they request through the Engine. Example:
Health Insights asks Lifestyle Coach about meals via Engine coordination.
Priority Hierarchy
Emergencies override everything. Clinical Monitor can take control during crisis. Other
agents pause until crisis resolved.
Notification Bundling
Multiple agent responses combined into single patient message. Prevents notification spam.
Rate Limiting
Maximum 5 notifications per day. Minimum 2 hours between notifications. Prevents fatigue.
Learning Loop
Health Insights learns from outcomes. Validates predictions. Updates correlations. System
gets smarter over time.
Human Oversight
Doctor Bridge ensures medical questions reach doctors when needed. AI handles routine,
escalates complex or dangerous situations.Summary
The ProCare 7-agent system works as a coordinated team with the Engagement Engine
orchestrating all interactions. Each agent specializes in its domain but collaborates
seamlessly through the Engine.
Key advantages of this architecture:
• Patients get coherent, unified responses (not 7 different messages)
• Emergencies always get priority attention
• Agents can be developed and improved independently
• System learns from every interaction
• Doctors stay informed without being overwhelmed
• Scales to thousands of patients with consistent quality
This architecture has been benchmarked against successful digital health platforms like
Livongo (diabetes management with 400K+ users) and Omada Health (chronic care with
proven clinical outcomes). The multi-agent approach provides the intelligence and
personalization needed for effective long-term patient engagement and outcomes
improvement.────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
