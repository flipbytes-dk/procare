What ProCare Does
ProCare is an AI-powered platform that helps patients manage chronic diseases (starting with diabetes) between doctor visits. It connects patients, doctors, and AI to provide continuous monitoring, personalized guidance, and early intervention.
This document outlines what the system must do for each stakeholder, written in plain English without technical jargon.
________________


What Patients Can Do
1. Log Health Data
Log glucose readings
Patient enters blood sugar value, system immediately tells them if it's safe, high, or low. Compares to their personal target. Shows trends over last 7 days.
Log meals with photos
Patient takes photo of food. System identifies what they ate, estimates carbs/protein/fat. Predicts how it will affect their glucose in 2 hours based on past history.
Track medications
Patient gets reminders when it's time to take medicine. Marks taken or skipped. If skipped, system asks why (side effects, forgot, feeling fine). Tracks adherence percentage.
Record symptoms
Patient reports feeling dizzy, nauseous, tired, etc. System asks follow-up questions (how long, how severe). Routes to doctor if concerning.
Track activity
Syncs with phone (Google Fit/Apple Health) for step count. Logs exercise sessions. Shows daily progress toward step goal.
2. Get Personalized Guidance
Immediate feedback on glucose
Every glucose reading gets instant response: "145 mg/dL - stable" or "88 mg/dL - too low, eat now". Explains what it means in simple terms.
Meal-specific predictions
"Based on 8 times you ate poha, your glucose will likely be 170-175 mg/dL after this breakfast." Uses YOUR history, not generic advice.
Activity recommendations
"You're at 6,200 steps. A 15-minute walk gets you to 7,500!" Or: "Evening walks lower your fasting glucose by 16 points - proven 12 times."
Personalized insights
"I analyzed your breakfasts: Paratha raises glucose to 188 vs poha to 172. Try more poha." Shows patterns specific to that patient.
Food questions answered
"Can I eat mango?" → "Yes! Limit to 100g, pair with meal, check glucose 2 hours after."
3. Emergency Help
Hypoglycemia (low glucose <60)
System immediately tells patient: "URGENT - Eat 15g fast carbs now (juice, glucose tablets, honey). Recheck in 15 minutes." Sets automatic recheck reminder. Alerts doctor.
Hyperglycemia (high glucose >400)
System asks about symptoms (nausea, vomiting, confusion). If present, directs to ER. If not, guides on hydration and insulin (if applicable). Alerts doctor immediately.
Symptom escalation
If patient reports severe symptoms (chest pain, extreme dizziness, confusion), system asks clarifying questions and recommends ER if needed. Always alerts doctor.
4. Learn About Their Condition
Educational articles
Based on what happens, system suggests relevant reading. Example: After hypoglycemia, offers "Understanding Low Blood Sugar and Prevention."
Onboarding learning path
New patients get 4 lessons over first week: What is diabetes, monitoring basics, how medications work, food and glucose.
Question answering
"Why does stress raise my glucose?" System explains cortisol/adrenaline in simple terms, offers full article if interested.
5. Communicate with Doctor
Ask questions anytime
Patient types question. AI answers if routine (food, activity). Routes to doctor if medical (medication changes, persistent symptoms, treatment decisions).
Receive doctor messages
Doctor sends message like "Good work!" System enhances it: "Good work! Your average dropped from 165 to 148 mg/dL. Keep up the medication adherence."
See what doctor sees
Patient can view their own weekly summary that doctor reviews. Creates transparency.
6. Stay Organized
Test reminders
2 weeks before HbA1c due: "Test due soon. Based on your data, I predict 6.9% (down from 7.1%!)." 1 week reminder. 1 day reminder with lab directions.
Medication refill alerts
7 days before running out: "Metformin will run out in 7 days. [Order Refill] [Download Prescription]" Can order through partner pharmacy or get prescription to order elsewhere.
Appointment scheduling
System recommends doctor visit if patterns concerning. Helps book appointment if patient wants.
Daily summary
End of day: "Today: ✓ All glucose logged ✓ Medications taken ✓ Step goal achieved. 18-day streak!"
________________


What Doctors Can Do
1. Monitor All Patients Efficiently
Weekly dashboard summary
Every Monday: "52 patients reviewed. 47 doing well ✓, 5 need attention ⚠, 0 urgent 🚨" Click to see details on the 5 who need attention. Others collapsed (can view if wanted).
Patient status at a glance
Each patient shows: Average glucose (7-day, 30-day), Medication adherence %, Engagement level, Any active flags (glucose trending up, multiple med skips, etc.)
Detailed patient view
Click any patient: See complete history, glucose charts, meal logs, medication adherence, patterns identified by AI, recent questions asked.
Pre-visit summary
Before appointment: System generates report of everything since last visit. Doctor can review in 2 minutes instead of asking patient to recall.
2. Respond to Issues
Critical alerts via WhatsApp
Emergency glucose readings: "⚠️ Mrs. Sharma glucose 58 mg/dL. AI guided her to eat. Recheck in 15 min. [Call Patient] [View Data]"
Urgent notifications
Patient asking about medication changes: "Patient wants to double dose due to high glucose. I told her to wait for your input. [View Context] [Call Patient]"
Pattern alerts
Glucose trending up over 2 weeks: "Mr. Kumar's average increased 165→195 over 2 weeks. Adherence good. May need medication adjustment. [View Charts]"
Medication adherence issues
Multiple skips due to side effects: "Patient skipped Metformin 3x this week - nausea. May need alternative. [Call Patient]"
3. Communicate with Patients
Send messages easily
Doctor types short message, system enhances with patient data. Example: "Keep it up" becomes "Keep it up! Your HbA1c improved 7.8→7.1%. Great work on medication adherence."
Review patient questions
See what patients asked AI. If AI answered well, just review. If patient needs personal input, can call or message.
Set patient-specific goals
Adjust glucose targets, step goals, check-in frequency for individual patients. System automatically uses these targets.
4. Manage Patient Care Plans
Update medications
Change dosage, add new medication, discontinue old one. System automatically updates reminders for patient starting next day.
Schedule tests
System auto-schedules HbA1c every 3 months. Doctor can override or add additional tests (lipid panel, kidney function, etc.)
Recommend content
Doctor can assign specific educational articles to patient. "Read this before next visit."
5. Track Practice Performance
Patient outcomes dashboard
See practice-wide metrics: Average HbA1c improvement, % patients reaching targets, Medication adherence rates, Engagement levels.
Revenue tracking
See monthly recurring revenue from ProCare subscriptions. Track active vs churned patients.
Efficiency metrics
Time saved: routine questions handled by AI, pre-visit prep time reduced, unnecessary calls prevented.

What the System Does Automatically
1. Intelligent Monitoring
Detect patterns
Analyzes every patient continuously. Finds: Which foods spike their glucose most, How activity affects them, Optimal medication timing, Early warning signs of issues.
Predict outcomes
Before meals: "This breakfast will likely result in 170-180 mg/dL for you." Before HbA1c test: "Based on 90 days, I predict your HbA1c will be 6.9%."
Validate predictions
After meal glucose logged, checks accuracy. "I predicted 170-180, you got 172. Consistent!" Uses this to improve future predictions.
Learn from outcomes
If patient reduces certain food and glucose improves, reinforces that behavior. System gets smarter for that specific patient over time.
2. Smart Notifications
Rate limiting
Maximum 5 notifications per day per patient. Minimum 2 hours between notifications. Prevents overwhelming patients.
Bundling
If 3 things to tell patient at once, combines into one message: "Three things: 1) ... 2) ... 3) ..." instead of 3 separate notifications.
Optimal timing
Learns when each patient typically opens app (e.g., 7 AM, 12:30 PM, 9 PM). Sends non-urgent notifications just before these times for higher engagement.
Emergency override
Critical alerts (glucose <60 or >400) bypass all limits and send immediately with alarm.
3. Re-engagement When Patients Go Inactive
Day 1 - Gentle reminder
Patient missed morning glucose: "We missed your fasting glucose today. Everything okay? [Log Now]"
Day 2 - Stronger nudge
Still no logs: "Haven't seen logs in 2 days. Dr. Verma monitors daily. Please catch up!"
Day 3 - WhatsApp outreach
Still inactive: Personal WhatsApp message asking if everything is okay.
Day 4 - Alert doctor
Notifies doctor: "Patient inactive 4 days. Possible issues: technical problem, lost motivation, health crisis. Suggest: Personal call."
If patient returns
Celebrates comeback, temporarily reduces expectations (1 log/day instead of 3), gradually increases as patient re-establishes routine.
4. Weekly Reporting
Patient weekly summary
Every Sunday, generates comprehensive report: Wins this week (glucose improved, adherence up), Areas to improve (step goal missed), Personalized insights (walk impact proven), Goals for next week.
Doctor weekly summary
For each doctor, summarizes all patients: Total count, How many doing well, How many need attention, How many urgent. Detailed view of each category.
Trend analysis
Compares week-over-week: "Your average glucose: 165→154 (-11 points). Medication adherence: 85%→92%. Time in range: 72%→76%."
5. Care Coordination
Test scheduling automation
Tracks when HbA1c due (every 3 months). Sends reminders (2 weeks, 1 week, 1 day before). Helps book lab appointment. Confirms appointment. Sends day-of reminder with directions.
Result processing
Patient uploads test result photo. System extracts value using OCR, confirms with patient. Compares to previous result. Analyzes what behaviors drove improvement. Celebrates success. Schedules next test.
Medication refill tracking
Tracks pills remaining based on daily usage. Alerts patient 7 days before running out. Can facilitate ordering through partner pharmacy or provide prescription to order elsewhere.
Visit recommendations
If concerning patterns detected (glucose consistently high, multiple medication skips, unexplained symptoms), suggests patient schedule doctor visit.

What ProCare Does NOT Do
To keep scope manageable and focus on core value, ProCare explicitly does NOT include:
* Replace doctors: ProCare supports doctors, never replaces them. All treatment decisions by doctors.
* Diagnose new conditions: If patient has symptoms of something new (not diabetes), system directs to doctor.
* Prescribe medications: Only doctors can prescribe. AI can remind, track adherence, flag issues.
* Connected glucose monitors (CGM): MVP uses manual entry. CGM integration is Phase 2.
* Insulin dose calculation: Too high-risk for AI. Directs patients to doctor for insulin adjustments.
* Direct video calls: Not a telemedicine platform. Doctor calls patient directly if needed.
* Health insurance claims: Patient manages insurance separately. Future: TPA partnerships.
* Multi-condition management: MVP focuses on diabetes. Future: hypertension, obesity, pre-diabetes.
* Family member access: MVP is patient-only. Future: family member monitoring for elderly.
* Social features: No patient-to-patient interaction, forums, or social networking.

Regulatory Requirements
Medical Device Classification
ProCare is a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). In India, if it only provides recommendations and doesn't control treatment directly, it may not require full medical device approval. However, must verify with CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organization).
Key regulatory requirements:
* Clear disclaimers: "This is not medical advice. Consult your doctor."
* No diagnosis claims: Cannot claim to diagnose diabetes or complications.
* Doctor oversight: All treatment decisions must be by licensed doctors.
* Data protection: Comply with India's Personal Data Protection Act.
* Informed consent: Patients must agree to data use, AI limitations.
* Adverse event reporting: Track and report any patient harm related to system use.
Platform Approvals Needed
* WhatsApp Business API: Requires privacy policy, terms of use, business verification. Meta approval process takes 2-4 weeks.
* Apple Health / Google Fit: Requires app privacy declaration, data usage justification. Usually 1-2 weeks approval.
* Payment gateways: Business verification, bank account verification, regulatory compliance. 1-2 weeks setup.
